less -S    Causes lines longer than the screen width to be chopped (truncated) rather than wrapped.       (terminal long string one line    easy to read)

less -r  display raw-control-characters (for example ctrl-A will be show and it have function in terminal so it may interrupt the result)

less -R similar to -r but only ANSI "color" escape sequences are output in 'raw' form.&#x20;
