# 2. quick start

Navigation, inspection and modification of a loaded binary file is performed using three simple actions: seek (to position), print (buffer), and alternate (write, append).

The 'seek' command is abbreviated as `s`

The 'print' command is abbreviated as `p`

To be allowed to write files, specify the `-w` option to radare2 when opening a file.

Appending a `?` to a command will show its help message, for example, `p?`. Appending `?*` will show commands starting with the given string, e.g. `p?*`

To enter visual mode, press `V<enter>`. Use `q` to quit visual mode and return to the prompt.

**I**n visual mode you can use HJKL keys to navigate (left, down, up, and right, respectively). You can use these keys in cursor mode toggled by `c` key.&#x20;

While in visual mode, you can also overwrite bytes by pressing `i`. You can press `TAB` to switch between the hex (middle) and string (right) columns.&#x20;

### Command Format

A general format for radare2 commands is as follows:

```
[.][times][cmd][~grep][@[@iter]addr!size][|>pipe] ;
```
